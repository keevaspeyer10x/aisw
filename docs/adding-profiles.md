# Adding profiles

```text
aisw add <tool> <profile> [--api-key KEY] [--from-env] [--from-live] [--label TEXT] [--credential-backend file|system-keyring] [--set-active]
```

`<tool>` is one of: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`.
`<profile>` is any identifier you choose: `work`, `personal`, `client-acme`, `ci`.

## API key

```sh
aisw add claude work --api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
aisw add codex work --api-key "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
aisw add gemini work --api-key "$GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

## From environment variable

Reads the key from the tool's standard environment variable:

| Tool | Variable |
|---|---|
| Claude | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Codex | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |

```sh
aisw add codex ci --from-env
```

Useful in CI where the key is already exported in the environment.

## Interactive OAuth

Without `--api-key`, `--from-env`, or `--from-live`, `add` launches the tool's native OAuth flow:

```sh
aisw add claude personal
aisw add codex personal
aisw add gemini personal
```

- Claude: spawns `claude auth login`. When the installed Claude build supports profile-scoped auth, `aisw` runs login inside the profile-owned `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`; otherwise it monitors the live credential file and Keychain for changes and captures the result there.
- Codex: sets `CODEX_HOME` to the profile directory and spawns `codex`. The device-auth flow writes credentials directly into that profile-owned isolated state. This is the durable ChatGPT-managed Codex path.
- Gemini: sets `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` to a scratch directory, spawns `gemini`, then copies the resulting auth/state files into the profile. The scratch directory is removed after the flow regardless of outcome.
- Antigravity: spawns `agy`, captures the resulting live keyring or native headless-file OAuth session plus the documented `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` and `~/.gemini/config/` state, then restores the prior live state unless `--set-active` is requested.

Claude OAuth support depends on how the installed Claude build scopes auth:
- File-backed or profile-scoped keychain auth: the interactive login is a durable isolated profile path.
- Legacy shared-Keychain auth: the profile is captured successfully, but `aisw use claude <name> --state-mode shared` is the supported runtime path because `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` does not own the live OAuth credential.
- Unknown keychain behavior: `aisw` will warn that isolated switching may not be durable until the profile is validated on that install.

Interactive OAuth requires a terminal and browser access. It is not available in `--non-interactive` mode.

Important Gemini note: current upstream Gemini CLI docs again recommend `Login with Google` for interactive local use. Some account types still require `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, including Workspace / Code Assist-style setups and certain region-limited cases. For headless or automation use, prefer `GEMINI_API_KEY` or Vertex AI.

## Capture current live credentials

Import what the tool is currently using, without launching a browser:

```sh
aisw add claude work --from-live
aisw add codex work --from-live
aisw add gemini work --from-live
aisw add antigravity work --from-live
```

This is the fastest path if you are already logged in. The captured profile is automatically set as active because those credentials are already live.

For Codex ChatGPT-managed auth, `--from-live` is compatibility/bootstrap only. It captures the current live session, but the durable setup is to re-login directly into the profile with interactive `aisw add codex <name>` so future upstream refreshes stay tied to that profile's own `CODEX_HOME`.

For Codex personal access token sessions, `--from-live` is the current `aisw` path: authenticate upstream with `codex login --with-access-token`, then import that live session. `aisw` treats those profiles separately from ChatGPT-managed refresh-token auth, so the shared-mode ChatGPT block does not apply to them.

For Claude OAuth, `--from-live` captures whatever Claude is currently using, but it does not upgrade a shared live session into an independently isolated auth owner. If the install still uses Claude's legacy shared Keychain credential, treat the imported profile as a captured shared-live session rather than as a durable isolated OAuth bundle.

For Antigravity OAuth, both interactive add and `--from-live` operate on the same shared live upstream model: `aisw` stores the current auth source and documented Antigravity config roots, then restores them on switch. On headless Linux, Antigravity 1.1.3+ can bypass an unavailable keyring and use `antigravity-oauth-token`; `aisw` accepts that token only when it is a regular, owner-owned `0600` file and refuses the profile if the keyring later becomes accessible. Upstream does not currently document an isolated per-profile auth root or profile selector.

If a profile with that name already exists, use `--yes` to overwrite it:

```sh
aisw add codex work --from-live --yes
```

## Useful flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--label TEXT` | Description shown in `aisw list` and `aisw status` |
| `--credential-backend file|system-keyring` | Override where `aisw` stores the managed profile secret |
| `--set-active` | Activates the profile immediately after adding (not needed with `--from-live`, which always activates) |

```sh
aisw add claude work --api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" --label "Work account" --set-active
```

## Profile storage

Profiles are stored under:

```text
~/.aisw/profiles/<tool>/<name>/
```

All credential files are written with `0600` permissions. The profile name is recorded in `~/.aisw/config.json` along with the auth method, storage backend, creation timestamp, and label.

`--credential-backend` controls the managed `aisw` profile storage backend, not the upstream CLI's live auth backend.

- `file`: portable and backup-friendly
- `system-keyring`: stronger local secret storage for Claude and Codex where the OS keyring is usable. Stored config and status output use `system_keyring`.
- Gemini remains file-managed because its auth is coupled to broader `~/.gemini/` state
- Antigravity supports `file` and `system-keyring` for the managed profile, but live auth is always restored into Antigravity's shared OS keyring entry.

## Duplicate account detection

When OAuth identity can be resolved from the captured credentials (via JWT claim or OAuth metadata), `aisw` checks whether the same underlying account is already stored under a different profile name. If it is, the `add` command is rejected with an error identifying the existing profile.

This prevents accidentally storing duplicate entries for the same account and having to track which name is the "real" one.
